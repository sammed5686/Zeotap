This repository contains the solutions for the Zeotap Assignment. The assignment includes three tasks focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), lookalike modeling, and customer segmentation through clustering.

Tasks

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset and derive meaningful business insights.

Deliverables:

sammed_barwade_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with EDA code.

sammed_barwade_EDA.pdf: PDF report containing business insights.

Task 2: Lookalike Model

Objective: Build a lookalike model to recommend similar customers based on transaction history and profile data.

Deliverables:

sammed_barwade_Lookalike.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook explaining the model development.

sammed_barwade_Lookalike.csv: CSV file containing top 3 lookalikes for the first 20 customers (C0001-C0020) in the format Map<cust_id, List<cust_id, score>>.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques and evaluate the results.

Deliverables:

sammed_barwade_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing clustering code.

sammed_barwade_Clustering.pdf: PDF report summarizing clustering results.
